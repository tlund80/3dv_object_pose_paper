abstract="The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008--2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community's progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.",

abstract="Recognizing 3D objects in the presence of noise, varying mesh resolution, occlusion and clutter is a very challenging task. This paper presents a novel method named Rotational Projection Statistics (RoPS). It has three major modules: local reference frame (LRF) definition, RoPS feature description and 3D object recognition. We propose a novel technique to define the LRF by calculating the scatter matrix of all points lying on the local surface. RoPS feature descriptors are obtained by rotationally projecting the neighboring points of a feature point onto 2D planes and calculating a set of statistics (including low-order central moments and entropy) of the distribution of these projected points. Using the proposed LRF and RoPS descriptor, we present a hierarchical 3D object recognition algorithm. The performance of the proposed LRF, RoPS descriptor and object recognition algorithm was rigorously tested on a number of popular and publicly available datasets. Our proposed techniques exhibited superior performance compared to existing techniques. We also showed that our method is robust with respect to noise and varying mesh resolution. Our RoPS based algorithm achieved recognition rates of 100, 98.9, 95.4 and 96.0 \% respectively when tested on the Bologna, UWA, Queen's and Ca' Foscari Venezia Datasets.",

abstract="We provide new insights to the problem of shape feature description and matching, techniques that are often applied within 3D object recognition pipelines. We subject several state of the art features to systematic evaluations based on multiple datasets from different sources in a uniform manner. We have carefully prepared and performed a neutral test on the datasets for which the descriptors have shown good recognition performance. Our results expose an important fallacy of previous results, namely that the performance of the recognition system does not correlate well with the performance of the descriptor employed by the recognition system. In addition to this, we evaluate several aspects of the matching task, including the efficiency of the different features, and the potential in using dimension reduction. To arrive at better generalization properties, we introduce a method for fusing several feature matches with a limited processing overhead. Our fused feature matches provide a significant increase in matching accuracy, which is consistent over all tested datasets. Finally, we benchmark all features in a 3D object recognition setting, providing further evidence of the advantage of fused features, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

journal="International Journal of Computer Vision",

volume="116",

pages="66--89",
abstract="A number of 3D local feature descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is however, unclear which descriptors are more appropriate for a particular application. A good descriptor should be descriptive, compact, and robust to a set of nuisances. This paper compares ten popular local feature descriptors in the contexts of 3D object recognition, 3D shape retrieval, and 3D modeling. We first evaluate the descriptiveness of these descriptors on eight popular datasets which were acquired using different techniques. We then analyze their compactness using the recall of feature matching per each float value in the descriptor. We also test the robustness of the selected descriptors with respect to support radius variations, Gaussian noise, shot noise, varying mesh resolution, distance to the mesh boundary, keypoint localization error, occlusion, clutter, and dataset size. Moreover, we present the performance results of these descriptors when combined with different 3D keypoint detection methods. We finally analyze the computational efficiency for generating each descriptor.",

    abstract     = "Not all interest points are equally interesting. The most valuable interest points lead to optimal performance of the computer vision method in which they are employed, but a measure of this kind will be dependent on the chosen vision application. We propose a more general performance measure based on spatial invariance of interest points under changing acquisition parameters by measuring the spatial recall rate. The scope of this paper is to investigate the performance of a number of existing well-established interest point detection methods. Automatic performance evaluation of interest points is hard because the true correspondence is generally unknown. We overcome this by providing an extensive data set with known spatial correspondence. The data is acquired with a camera mounted on a {6-}axis industrial robot providing very accurate camera positioning. Furthermore the scene is scanned with a structured light scanner resulting in precise {3D} surface information. In total 60 scenes are depicted ranging from model houses, building material, fruit and vegetables, fabric, printed media and more. Each scene is depicted from 119 camera positions and 19 individual {LED} illuminations are used for each position. The {LED} illumination provides the option for artificially relighting the scene from a range of light directions. This data set has given us the ability to systematically evaluate the performance of a number of interest point detectors. The highlights of the conclusions are that the fixed scale Harris corner detector performs overall best followed by the Hessian based detectors and the difference of Gaussian (DoG). The methods based on scale space features have an overall better performance than other methods especially when varying the distance to the scene, where especially {FAST} corner detector, Edge Based Regions (EBR) and Intensity Based Regions (IBR) have a poor performance. The performance of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) is moderate. We observe a relatively large decline in performance with both change in viewpoint  and light direction."

abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a highly distinctive local surface feature called the TriSI feature for recognizing 3D objects in the presence of clutter and occlusion. For a feature point, we first construct a unique and repeatable Local Reference Frame (LRF) using the implicit geometrical information of neighboring triangular faces. We then generate three signatures from the three orthogonal coordinate axes of the LRF. These signatures are concatenated and then compressed into a TriSI feature. Finally, we propose an effective 3D object recognition algorithm based on hierarchical feature matching. We tested our TriSI feature on two popular datasets. Rigorous experimental results show that the TriSI feature was highly descriptive and outperformed existing algorithms under all levels of Gaussian noise, Laplacian noise, shot noise, varying mesh resolutions, occlusion, and clutter. Moreover, we tested our TriSI-based 3D object recognition algorithm on four standard datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieved the best overall recognition results on these datasets. "

One advantage of the method is, that the projection device cam, but is not required to be stable over time nor does it have to be calibrated. The new method therefore allows us to use an off-the-shelf multimedia projector to acquire dense 3D data of large objects in a matter of seconds. Since we are able to control our source of illumination, we can also acquire registered color information using standard monochrome cameras.},
